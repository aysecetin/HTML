 
# HTML Website base

- Although it is true that you can write any HTML you want and customize your website, there are some tags that you must include and some that you definitely should include. Every time you start to write an HTML document, your setup should look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        
    </head>
    <body>
    
    </body>
</html>
```

Let's analyze and explain this.

The first tag we see is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

- This tag is a special tag that should be included in every HTML document. This is the first tag you should write when writing HTML. It does not have a closing tag, and all it does is tell the computer reading the document that it includes HTML. It literally says: The type of this document is HTML.


The next tag is:

```html
<html> </html>
```

- This tag should be included, and all it does is tell the computer reading the document where the HTML code begins and where it ends. All of your HTML code should be written inside.


The next tag is:

```html
<head> </head>
```
- This tag is literally the head of the website. It goes inside the <html> tag. There is some content that we will be putting in this tag, but all of the HTML we write in the head will not be a visual element on the website. The head tag is there to write tags that give information about the website, and it is mostly used by the actual browser, not to put visual elements on the website.




The next tag is:

```html
<body> </body>
```

- This tag is literally the body of the website. It goes inside the html tag, and it includes all the visual content of the website. Every element that you want to add should be written here. You can add text, buttons, and any other element you can think of. This is the visual part of the website that users will see.
