# *TAG ATTRIBUTES*

Tags can also have attributes. There are some attributes that can be used with every tag, some that are specific to some tags, and attributes that you can assign yourself. The attributes go inside the start of the tag, <p> after the name of the tag. The attributes modify the elements. For example:

```html
<p color="red">WOW I have an attribute!</p>
```
We write the name of the attribute first, an equal sign = right next to it, and the value of the attribute in parentheses " ".

**EXAMPLE**  
You are given an HTML code, add to the _<p>_tag the attribute color with the value “blue”

**SOLUTION**
```html
<p color="blue">This is some text!</p>
```
