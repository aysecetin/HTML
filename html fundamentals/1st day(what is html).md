# What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language for structuring websites. It uses tags to format content and create links. HTML provides the basic structure, while CSS styles it and JavaScript adds interactivity. Together, they form the core of modern web development.
```html
<p> Hello HTML! </p>
```

## Tag Attributes

Tags can also have attributes. There are some attributes that can be used with every tag, some that are specific to some tags, and attributes that you can assign yourself. The attributes go inside the start of the tag, <p> after the name of the tag. The attributes modify the elements. For example:

```html
<p color="red">WOW I have an attribute!</p>
```
- We write the name of the attribute first, an equal sign = right next to it, and the value of the attribute in parentheses " ".
